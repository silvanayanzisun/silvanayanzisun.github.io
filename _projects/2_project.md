**Project Title**: Style Length, Pollen Deposition, and Reproductive Fitness for a Native California Wildflower  
**Presented at**: UCSB EEMB Undergraduate Research Symposium (April 2023)  
**Affiliation**: Mazer Lab, Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology  
**Mentors**: Helen Payne, Dr. Susan Mazer  

This project investigated whether a physical floral traitâ€”**style length**â€”affects **pollination success** and **reproductive fitness** in *Nemophila menziesii*, a native California wildflower dependent on insect pollinators. It integrates concepts from plant ecology, evolution, and reproductive biology to explore how morphology influences fitness in wild populations.

## Research Questions

1. Does **style length** influence:
   - a) the amount of **pollen deposition**?
   - b) **lifetime fecundity** (total fruit count Ã— mean seeds per fruit)?

2. Is **longer style length** under positive selection in this wild population?

---

## Methods

**Field Data Collection**
- **683 floral styles** collected from **118 plants** at the Hastings Natural History Reservation (Spring 2022)
- Study site represented a typical **drought year**, influencing resource availability

**Lab Techniques**
- **Pollen Staining** using Alexander's stain to distinguish viable vs non-viable grains
- **Microscopy** to quantify **60,929 pollen grains**
- **Digital Morphometrics**:
  - Used **ImageJ** to photograph and calibrate style measurements with a digital scale

**Statistical Analysis**
- Multiple regression models to evaluate relationships between:
  - Style length and pollen deposition
  - Pollen deposition and lifetime fecundity
- Controlled for covariates such as **stem biomass**, **corolla size**, and **block effects**

---

## Results

- **Style length was positively associated with pollen deposition**
- **No significant relationship** between pollen deposition and lifetime fecundity
- Suggests **longer styles were not under directional selection** in this season
