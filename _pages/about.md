Hi, I’m Yanzi “Silvana” Sun. I’m currently pursuing a Master of Data Science in Health at UCLA. With a strong foundation in bioinformatics, computational biology, and statistical modeling, I have hands-on experience in NGS data analysis, multi-omics integration, and machine learning techniques including SVM, XGBoost, and Random Forest.

I’m proficient in R, Python, SAS, Git, and R Shiny, and have experience working with Docker, cloud computing platforms (GCP, Hoffman2), and building reproducible data pipelines and interactive dashboards for biological data exploration.

I’m passionate about leveraging data-driven approaches to drive innovation in biomedical research and therapeutic development.
