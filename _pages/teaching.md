### Research Immersion Laboratory in Microbiology – Teaching Assistant

_UCLA, Winter 2025_

I mentored student teams conducting self-directed research projects aimed at discovering novel microorganisms related to antibiotic resistance, biofuel production, and plant growth promotion. The course emphasized hypothesis-driven inquiry, scientific literature analysis, and critical thinking.

Students gained hands-on experience in microbiology and molecular biology, alongside training in **bioinformatics** and **phylogenetics tools** for analyzing metagenomic data. I supported them in interpreting experimental results, applying computational workflows, and developing key research skills including record keeping, data ethics, and scientific communication.

### Research Immersion Laboratory in Virology – Teaching Assistant

_UCLA, Fall 2024, Spring 2025_

I supported students in a hands-on, research-focused course centered on the discovery and annotation of novel bacteriophages. The curriculum integrated microbiology, molecular biology, and computational analysis, with an emphasis on scientific reasoning and experimental design.

Students used bioinformatics tools such as **PECAAN**, **Phamerator**, **Starterator**, **BLASTp**, and **HHpred** to analyze viral genomes, identify gene functions, and finalize genome annotations. I provided guidance on interpreting data, evaluating hypotheses, and developing scientific writing and communication skills.
